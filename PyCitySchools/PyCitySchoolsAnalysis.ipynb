    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The PyCity School District consists of 15 high schools (grades 9-12) with a total student body of 39,170 (average of 2,611.33 students per school).  Eight of the schools are Charter schools.\n",
    "- The District-wide passing rates for reading are significantly higher than those for math with 85.80% of district-wide students passing reading (or 33,608 students) and 74.98% passing math (or 29,370 students).\n",
    "- The District-wide average budget per student is $629.29, but this varies considerably by school. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - The lowest school budget per student is $578 \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The highest school budget per student is $655.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - That is a $77 per student difference between the highest and lowest funded school.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- All of the Charter schools within the PyCity District are lower in student population (ranging between 427 to 2,283) than the District schools (ranging between 2,739 to 4,976).\n",
    "- All but one of the Charter schools are lower in per student budget (ranging between 578 to 625) than the District schools (ranging between 628 to 655). \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Johnson HS, a Charter school, has a per student budget of $638.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The overall passing percentages between the District and Charter schools is alarming:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - District oveall passing percentages range between 52.99% (3,999 students, 637 per student) to 54.64% (4,976 students, $628 per student).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Charter schools overall passing percentages range between 89.23% (427 students, 581 per student) to 91.33% (1,858 students, $582 per student).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- District students passing percentages for reading and math vary greatly (~ 80% vs ~ 66%) while Charter students passing percentages for reading and math vary little (~ 90% vs ~ 96%).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Conclusion:\n",
    "- High student achievement seems to be more correlated with lower student bodies than with higher budget.\n",
    "- Charter schools consistently perform better than District schools, and in all measured areas.\n",
    "- What this data does not tell us is teacher to student ratio, attendance rates, household incomes, and other criteria that could impact student achievement.\n",
